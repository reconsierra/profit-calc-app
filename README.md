# Profit Calculator – Sales Enablement Tool

## Purpose

This calculator has been developed to support a strategic shift in how we approach selling Wurth products—particularly the small, often overlooked items. As the project sponsor, my goal is to help our salesforce reframe these products not as cost-centre stock, but as genuine profit-making opportunities for our customers.

By using this tool, reps can demonstrate to service customers how even modest mark-ups on small items can add up to meaningful profit. This is not just about numbers—it’s about building trust, loyalty, and long-term value in every customer interaction.

## Functionality

The calculator allows reps to:
- Input the cost price and suggested sell price of any item.
- See the profit per unit and total profit based on quantity sold.
- Model different pricing scenarios to show customers how small adjustments can improve their margins.
- Bundle multiple items to demonstrate cumulative profit potential.

It’s designed to be quick, clear, and mobile-friendly—ideal for use during customer visits or sales calls.

## Best Utilisation

To get the most out of this tool, reps should:

1. **Use it as a conversation starter**  
   Introduce the calculator when discussing consumables or service items. Show how these products can quietly boost profitability without disrupting the customer’s core business.

2. **Build trust through transparency**  
   Walk customers through the numbers. Let them see the logic and simplicity behind the profit opportunity. This builds credibility and positions Wurth as a partner in their success.

3. **Highlight margin-makers**  
   Focus on items with strong resale potential. Use the calculator to compare options and help customers choose products that work best for their business model.

4. **Incorporate into training and meetings**  
   Share examples of successful use in team huddles or sales meetings. Encourage reps to roleplay customer conversations using the calculator.

5. **Link to broader enablement tools**  
   Use alongside platforms like SpeedyCat and Coolius to identify high-margin items and track conversion. The calculator complements these tools by adding a customer-facing layer of value.

## Final Note

This tool is part of a broader transformation. It’s not just about selling more—it’s about selling smarter. I encourage all reps to explore its potential, share feedback, and contribute ideas that help embed profit-centre thinking into our daily routines.

Let’s help our customers see the value in every item—and grow our business by growing theirs.
